# Mixture Model Approach For Large Scale Testing Problem
Screen differentially expressed genes and gene-gene linkage associations 

## Boosted EM algorithm for fitting the mixture of Uniform and Beta Distributions

We develop a new approach to conduct the large scale testing problems simultaneously by using the marginal p-values.
